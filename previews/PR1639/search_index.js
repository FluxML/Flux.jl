Then:\n\nfilter should be a tuple of N integers.\nKeywords stride and dilation should each be either single integer, or a tuple with N integers.\nKeyword pad can be:\na single integer for equal padding all around,\na tuple of N integers, to apply the same padding at begin/end of each spatial dimension,\na tuple of 2*N integers, for asymmetric padding, or\nthe singleton SamePad(), to calculate padding such that size(output,d) == size(x,d) / stride (possibly rounded) for each spatial dimension.\n\nAccepts two keywords to control its parameters:\n\nInitial weights are generated by the function init = glorot_uniform.\nInitial bias is zero by default, this can be disabled entirely with bias = false, or another vector provided as bias = randn(Float32, out).\n\nSee also ConvTranspose, DepthwiseConv, CrossCor.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> xs = rand(Float32, 100, 100, 3, 50); # a batch of images\n\njulia> lay = Conv((5,5), 3 => 7, relu; bias=false)\nConv((5, 5), 3 => 7, relu, bias=false)  # 525 parameters\n\njulia> lay(xs) |> size\n(96, 96, 7, 50)\n\njulia> Conv((5,5), 3 => 7; stride=2)(xs) |> size\n(48, 48, 7, 50)\n\njulia> Conv((5,5), 3 => 7; stride=2, pad=SamePad())(xs) |> size\n(50, 50, 7, 50)\n\njulia> Conv((1,1), 3 => 7; pad=(20,10,0,0))(xs) |> size\n(130, 100, 7, 50)\n\njulia> Conv((5,5), 3 => 7; stride=2, dilation=4)(xs) |> size\n(42, 42, 7, 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"models/layers/#Flux.AdaptiveMaxPool","page":"Model Reference","title":"Flux.AdaptiveMaxPool","text":"AdaptiveMaxPool(out::NTuple)\n\nAdaptive max pooling layer.
