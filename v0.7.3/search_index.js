    "category": "section",
    "text": "Flux is a library for machine learning. It comes \"batteries-included\" with many useful tools built in, but also lets you use the full power of the Julia language where you need it. We follow a few key principles:Doing the obvious thing. Flux has relatively few explicit APIs for features like regularisation or embeddings. Instead, writing down the mathematical form will work – and be fast.\nYou could have written Flux. All of it, from LSTMs to GPU kernels, is straightforward Julia code. When in doubt, it’s well worth looking at the source. If you need something different, you can easily roll your own.\nPlay nicely with others. Flux works well with Julia libraries from data frames and images to differential equation solvers, so you can easily build complex data processing pipelines that integrate Flux models."

This documentation provides a reference to all of Flux\'s APIs, as well as a from-scratch introduction to Flux\'s take on models and how they work. Once you understand these docs, congratulations, you also understand Flux\'s source code, which is intended to be concise, legible and a good reference for more advanced concepts."

    "page": "Basics",
    "title": "Taking Gradients",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Flux\'s core feature is taking gradients of Julia code. The gradient function takes another Julia function f and a set of arguments, and returns the gradient with respect to each argument. (It\'s a good idea to try pasting these examples in the Julia terminal.)using Flux.Tracker\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1\n\n# df/dx = 6x + 2\ndf(x) = Tracker.gradient(f, x; nest = true)[1]\n\ndf(2) # 14.0 (tracked)\n\n# d²f/dx² = 6\nd2f(x) = Tracker.gradient(df, x; nest = true)[1]\n\nd2f(2) # 6.0 (tracked)(We\'ll learn more about why these numbers show up as (tracked) below.)When a function has many parameters, we can pass them all in explicitly:f(W, b, x) = W * x + b\n\nTracker.gradient(f, 2, 3, 4)\n# (4.0 (tracked), 1.0 (tracked), 2.0 (tracked))But machine learning models can have hundreds of parameters! Flux offers a nice way to handle this. We can tell Flux to treat something as a parameter via param. Then we can collect these together and tell gradient to collect the gradients of all params at once.W = param(2) # 2.0 (tracked)\nb = param(3) # 3.0 (tracked)\n\nf(x) = W * x + b\n\ngrads = Tracker.gradient(() -> f(4), params(W, b))\n\ngrads[W] # 4.0\ngrads[b] # 1.0There are a few things to notice here. Firstly, W and b now show up as tracked. Tracked things behave like normal numbers or arrays, but keep records of everything you do with them, allowing Flux to calculate their gradients. gradient takes a zero-argument function; no arguments are necessary because the params tell it what to differentiate.This will come in really handy when dealing with big, complicated models. For now, though, let\'s start with something simple."

If we have some data we can already try training the model.All deep learning in Flux, however complex, is a simple generalisation of this example. Of course, models can look very different – they might have millions of parameters or complex control flow. Let\'s see how Flux handles more complex models."

    "text": "It\'s common to create more complex models than the linear regression above. For example, we might want to have two linear layers with a nonlinearity like sigmoid (σ) in between them.

You just built the Dense layer that comes with Flux.

The model now takes the old h as an input, and produces a new h as output, each time we run it.h = # ... initial state ...\nh, y₁ = f(h, x₁)\nh, y₂ = f(h, x₂)\nh, y₃ = f(h, x₃)\n# ...Information stored in h is preserved for the next prediction, allowing it to function as a kind of memory. This also means that the prediction made for a given x depends on all the inputs previously fed into the model.(This might be important if, for example, each x represents one word of a sentence; the model\'s interpretation of the word \"bank\" should change if the previous input was \"river\" rather than \"investment\".)Flux\'s RNN support closely follows this mathematical perspective.

There are various recurrent cells available, which are documented in the layer reference. The hand-written example above can be replaced with:using Flux\n\nrnn2 = Flux.RNNCell(10, 5)\n\nx = rand(10) # dummy data\nh = rand(5)  # initial hidden state\n\nh, y = rnn2(h, x)"

If we then calculate another 10 inputs we have to calculate 110 gradients – this accumulates and quickly becomes expensive.To avoid this we can truncate the gradient calculation, forgetting the history.truncate!(m)Calling truncate! wipes the slate clean, so we can call the model with more inputs without building up an expensive gradient computation.truncate! makes sense when you are working with multiple chunks of a large sequence, but we may also want to work with a set of independent sequences. In this case the hidden state should be completely reset to its original value, throwing away any accumulated information. reset! does this for you."
