Flux is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support. Flux makes the easy things easy while remaining fully hackable.

```julia
] add Flux
```

See the [documentation](https://fluxml.github.io/Flux.jl/) or the [model zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/) for examples.

If you use Flux in your research, please [cite](CITATION.bib) our work.
