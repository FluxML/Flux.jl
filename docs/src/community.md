# Community

All Flux users are welcome to join our community on the [Julia forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/), or the [slack](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/announcing-a-julia-slack/4866) (channel #machine-learning). If you have questions or issues we'll try to help you out.

If you're interested in hacking on Flux, the [source code](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) is open and easy to understand -- it's all just the same Julia code you work with normally. You might be interested in our [intro issues](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get started.
