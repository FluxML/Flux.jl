# Community

All Flux users are welcome to join our community on the [Julia forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/), the [slack](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/announcing-a-julia-slack/4866) (channel #machine-learning), or Flux's [Gitter](https://gitter.im/FluxML/Lobby). If you have questions or issues we'll try to help you out.

If you're interested in hacking on Flux, the [source code](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) is open and easy to understand -- it's all just the same Julia code you work with normally. You might be interested in our [intro issues](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to get started.
