# Utility Functions

Flux contains some utility functions for working with data; these functions
help create inputs for your models or batch your dataset.
Other functions can be used to initialize your layers or to regularly execute
callback functions.

## Working with Data

```@docs
Flux.unsqueeze
Flux.stack
Flux.unstack
Flux.chunk
Flux.frequencies
Flux.batch
Flux.batchseq
Base.rpad(v::AbstractVector, n::Integer, p)
```

## Layer Initialization

These are primarily useful if you are planning to write your own layers.
Flux initializes convolutional layers and recurrent cells with `glorot_uniform`
by default.
To change the default on an applicable layer, pass the desired function with the
`init` keyword. For example:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using Flux)
julia> conv = Conv((3, 3), 1 => 8, relu; init=Flux.glorot_normal)
Conv((3, 3), 1 => 8, relu)  # 80 parameters
```

```@docs
Flux.glorot_uniform
Flux.glorot_normal
Flux.kaiming_uniform
Flux.kaiming_normal
Flux.orthogonal
Flux.sparse_init
```

## Changing the type of model parameters

```@docs
Flux.f64
Flux.f32
```

The default `eltype` for models is `Float32` since models are often trained/run on GPUs. The `eltype` of model `m` can be changed to `Float64` by `f64(m)`, or to `Float32` by `f32(m)`.

## Model Building

Flux provides some utility functions to help you generate models in an automated fashion.

[`outputsize`](@ref) enables you to calculate the output sizes of layers like [`Conv`](@ref)
when applied to input samples of a given size. This is achieved by passing a "dummy" array into
the model that preserves size information without running any computation.
`outputsize(f, inputsize)` works for all layers (including custom layers) out of the box.
By default, `inputsize` expects the batch dimension,
but you can exclude the batch size with `outputsize(f, inputsize; padbatch=true)` (assuming it to be one).

Using this utility function lets you automate model building for various inputs like so:
```julia
"""
    make_model(width, height, inchannels, nclasses;
               layer_config = [16, 16, 32, 32, 64, 64])

Create a CNN for a given set of configuration parameters.

# Arguments
- `width`: the input image width
- `height`: the input image height
- `inchannels`: the number of channels in the input image
- `nclasses`: the number of output classes
- `layer_config`: a vector of the number of filters per each conv layer
"""
function make_model(width, height, inchannels, nclasses;
                    layer_config = [16, 16, 32, 32, 64, 64])
  # construct a vector of conv layers programmatically
  conv_layers = [Conv((3, 3), inchannels => layer_config[1])]
  for (infilters, outfilters) in zip(layer_config, layer_config[2:end])
    push!(conv_layers, Conv((3, 3), infilters => outfilters))
  end

  # compute the output dimensions for the conv layers
  # use padbatch=true to set the batch dimension to 1
  conv_outsize = Flux.outputsize(conv_layers, (width, height, nchannels); padbatch=true)

  # the input dimension to Dense is programatically calculated from
  #  width, height, and nchannels
  return Chain(conv_layers..., Dense(prod(conv_outsize), nclasses))
end
```

Flux.outputsize

## Model Abstraction

## Callback Helpers

```@docs
Flux.throttle
Flux.stop
Flux.skip
```

## Patience Helpers

Flux provides utilities for controlling your training procedure according to some monitored condition and a maximum `patience`. For example, you can use `early_stopping` to stop training when the model is converging or deteriorating, or you can use `plateau` to check if the model is stagnating.

For example, below we create a pseudo-loss function that decreases, bottoms out, then increases. The early stopping trigger will break the loop before the loss increases too much.
```julia
# create a pseudo-loss that decreases for 4 calls, then starts increasing
# we call this like loss()
loss = let t = 0
  () -> begin
    t += 1
    (t - 4) ^ 2
  end
end

# create an early stopping trigger
# returns true when the loss increases for two consecutive steps
es = early_stopping(loss, 2; init_score = 9)

# this will stop at the 6th (4 decreasing + 2 increasing calls) epoch
@epochs 10 begin
  es() && break
end
```

The keyword argument `distance` of `early_stopping` is a function of the form `distance(best_score, score)`. By default `distance` is `-`, which implies that the monitored metric `f` is expected to be decreasing and mimimized. If you use some increasing metric (e.g. accuracy), you can customize the `distance` function: `(best_score, score) -> score - best_score`.
```julia
# create a pseudo-accuracy that increases by 0.01 each time from 0 to 1
# we call this like acc()
acc = let v = 0
  () -> v = max(1, v + 0.01)
end

# create an early stopping trigger for accuracy
es = early_stopping(acc, 3; delta = (best_score, score) -> score - best_score)

# this will iterate until the 10th epoch
@epochs 10 begin
  es() && break
end
```

`early_stopping` and `plateau` are both built on top of `patience`. You can use `patience` to build your own triggers that use a patient counter. For example, if you want to trigger when the loss is below a threshold for several consecutive iterations:
```julia
threshold(f, thresh, delay) = patience(delay) do
  f() < thresh
end
```

Both `predicate` in `patience` and `f` in `early_stopping` / `plateau` can accept extra arguments. You can pass such extra arguments to `predicate` or `f` through the returned function:
```julia
trigger = patience((a; b) -> a > b, 3)

# this will iterate until the 10th epoch
@epochs 10 begin
  trigger(1; b = 2) && break
end

# this will stop at the 3rd epoch
@epochs 10 begin
  trigger(3; b = 2) && break
end
```
