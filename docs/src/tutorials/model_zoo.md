# Model Zoo 

The [model zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo) is a collection of examples that demonstrate how to build and train models using Flux. The examples are organised by domain and include vision, text, and audio. Each example includes a description of the model, the data used, and the training process.

Some of the examples are pedagogical, see for instance
- [Multilayer Perceptron](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/master/vision/mlp_mnist)
- [Simple Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/master/vision/conv_mnist)

Others are more advanced, see for instance
- [Variational Autoencoder](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/master/vision/vae_mnist)
