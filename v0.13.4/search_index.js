The data type has to be supported by numobs and getobs.\nbatchsize: If less than 0, iterates over individual observations. Otherwise, each iteration (except possibly the last) yields a mini-batch containing batchsize observations. Default 1.\nbuffer: If buffer=true and supported by the type of data, a buffer will be allocated and reused for memory efficiency. You can also pass a preallocated object to buffer. Default false.\ncollate: Batching behavior. If nothing (default), a batch is getobs(data, indices). If false, each batch is  [getobs(data, i) for i in indices]. When true, applies batch to the vector of observations in a batch,   recursively collating arrays in the last dimensions. See batch for more information and examples.\nparallel: Whether to use load data in parallel using worker threads. Greatly   speeds up data loading by factor of available threads. Requires starting   Julia with multiple threads. Check Threads.nthreads() to see the number of   available threads. Passing parallel = true breaks ordering guarantees.   Default false.\npartial: This argument is used only when batchsize > 0. If partial=false and the number of observations is not divisible by the batchsize, then the last mini-batch is dropped. Default true.\nrng: A random number generator. Default Random.GLOBAL_RNG.\nshuffle: Whether to shuffle the observations before iterating. Unlike   wrapping the data container with shuffleobs(data), shuffle=true ensures   that the observations are shuffled anew every time you start iterating over   eachobs.

If you just want to get started writing models, the model zoo gives good starting points for many common ones. This documentation provides a reference to all of Flux's APIs, as well as a from-scratch introduction to Flux's take on models and how they work. Once you understand these docs, congratulations, you also understand Flux's source code, which is intended to be concise, legible and a good reference for more advanced concepts.","category":"page"},{"location":"models/basics/#Flux-Basics","page":"Basics","title":"Flux Basics","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/basics/#Taking-Gradients","page":"Basics","title":"Taking Gradients","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/basics/","page":"Basics","title":"Basics","text":"Flux's core feature is taking gradients of Julia code.
